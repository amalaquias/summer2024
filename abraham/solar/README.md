This folder contains the csv file used for training and the model training script. The dataset is comprised of image paths and their corresponding wattage value. The model I trained was a regression model that estimating the solar wattage based on a given sky face image. The dataset images can be found in /lcrc/project/waggle/summer_projects/summer2024/ruben_abraham. In this folder, you will see a zip file called "watt_model_dataset." Once extracted, it contains the "storage.sagecontinuum.org" folder which contains all of the images I used. The model is also found in the "ruben_abraham" folder called "resnet50Watt.pth."
