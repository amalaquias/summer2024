# About Me
Hi, my name is Ruben Abraham and I go to the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I am eager to learn and help other people with their problems. I hope I can provide some quality research for the SAGE/Waggle team for this internship! 

I will be working on observing LiDAR data and its benefits to solar irradiance and sky classification models this summer!
