This folder contains two scripts, one to plot the mpl file itself in color and another to plot 5 minute intervals of the mpl file. These scripts will work on the mini_mpl zip files found in /lcrc/project/waggle/public_html/datasets after you have downloaded them to you local machine. There is also another file in the "datasets" folder called "LiDAR_clearhazy.zip" that contains 1 day worth of clear sky conditions and 12 hours worth of hazy sky conditions. 

To download files from lcrc to a local path on your computer
 ```sh
scp your_username@lcrc.anl.gov:/lcrc/project/waggle/public_html/datasets/yourfile.txt /your/local/path/on/computer
