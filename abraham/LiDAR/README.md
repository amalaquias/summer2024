This folder contains two scripts, one to plot the mpl file itself in color and another to plot 5 minute intervals of the mpl file. These scripts will work on the mini_mpl zip files found in /lcrc/project/waggle/public_html/datasets after you have downloaded them to you local machine. 

## To download files from lcrc to a local path on your computer
 ```sh
scp your_username@lcrc.anl.gov:/lcrc/project/waggle/public_html/datasets/minimpl_202203.mpl /your/local/path/on/computer
