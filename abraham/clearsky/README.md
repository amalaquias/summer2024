This folder contains the model training file and the dataset it was trained on. The model itself is too big to put on here, but the model basically is able to decide whether an image is clear sky, 0, or other, 1. The dataset it was trained on contains image file paths and their corresponding label. The images are located in /lcrc/project/waggle/summer_projects/summer2024/ruben_abraham. In this folder, there is a file called "clear_model_dataset.zip." Once you extract the file, you can find the "0" class folder containing clear images, the "1" class folder containing other images, and the "allday" folder containing all of the images. The model I trained on this dataset is also located in the "ruben_abraham" folder and named "resnet50_clearsky.pth."
