This folder contains the model training file and the dataset it was trained on. The model itself is too big to put on here, but the model basically is able to decide whether an image is clear sky, 0, or other, 1. The dataset it was trained on contains image file paths and their corresponding label. The "clear sky" class was much smaller than the "other" class, so I duplicated the "clear sky" class until it was close in amount to the "other" class. This was ok, because during model training each one of the images would undergo transformations.
