# Running Blade Code

## plugin-capture-gpu-blade

This code is able to run inferencing on a url or (untested) a -stream camera. I have not tried that on this program though.

It is also on dockerhub!
```

```

## Blade-Simple

This code automatically generates a description for an image that is already in the container. With CUDA

Consider this as a test version that can be further modified to fit your needs.
