# Chris Marshall Summer 2024
## Who Am I?
Hello! My name is Chris Marshall, and I'm working as a SULI intern at Argonne National Laboratory this summer. I'm a rising senior at the University of Chicago where I'm studying Computer Science and Math. Outside of academics, I love to cook and bake, play percussion, and explore the city of Chicago.

## My Project
This summer, I'm working on resource management for the DAWN project.
