It's my first day! My day started with orientation from 9-12. After that, I met my team for the first time! Following lunch, I met with my mentor Yongho to learn about my project--working on resource management in the DAWN project. I spent the rest of the afternoon getting through onboarding documents and starting to dig into the project.

My second day was just an onboarding day. I started the day with orientation from 9-12. Then I set up my Google Drive and Github folders for storing my work this summer. I finished the day with more required trainings.
