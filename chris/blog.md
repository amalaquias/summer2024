It's my first day! My day started with orientation from 9-12. After that, I met my team for the first time! Following lunch, I met with my mentor Yongho to learn about my project--working on resource management in the DAWN project. I spent the rest of the afternoon getting through onboarding documents and starting to dig into the project.

My second day was just an onboarding day. I started the day with orientation from 9-12. Then I set up my Google Drive and Github folders for storing my work this summer. I finished the day with more required trainings.

Today I finished up the required trainings! After that, I was able to talk through my design with Yongho. We made sure to resolve any confusion and align on the project. As of now, our current plan of action is to create an ansible playbook that setups an individual Jetson Nano for local performance metrics. This is currently missing from the current Waggle stack. Several of the pieces are there, but they are scattered throughout the code base. With a uniform setup, we have a playground where we can test various things like analysis tools for an eventual deployment to the Waggle stack. I finished off the day by provisioning a Jetson Nano to start working on my project.
