## Week 1 
### May 28th - 31st
I spent most of my time this week completing the new hire training and writing notes on ML/AI topics, including various sources I've found on my own and each of the following papers recommended by Dario.

## Week 2
### June 3rd
Finished up the papers and other material from week 1. I feel that I have a much better grasp on the basics now. 

Cloned the audio separation/classification models from Google's repos and began setting up my environment.

### June 4th
Began learning PyTorch, including successfully running several pre-trained image and audio classifier models.

### June 5th - 7th
Set up my SSH keys and got access to `bebop` on `lcrc`. 

Continued learning PyTorch for the remainder of the week.


## Week 3
### June 10th
Went to the required writing coach meeting in the morning.

Gained SSH access to ALCF/Polaris. 

Did more work with PyTorch in the morning before speaking with Dario and narrowing the scope of my project somewhat. Instead of rewriting Google's models from Tensorflow to PyTorch, I will instead focus on implementing the existing models on the Waggle infrastructure. This seems much more feasible given the time left for this internship.

### June 11th
Began working through the edge app tutorial from the documentation on [sagecontinuum.org](https://sagecontinuum.org/docs/category/edge-apps). Waiting on access to the waggle nodes / blade servers to continue on to parts 3 and 4. 
Started learning Docker.

### June 12th
Like PyTorch, Docker was a new experience for me. But given some practice I now feel comfortable setting up new images and containers from dockerfiles and the CLI. 

I was also given access to the nodes V009-V012, V029-V039. With a proper environment set up, I should be able to make much faster progress now.
