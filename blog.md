I worked on finishing all my trainings and Seongha gave me a rundown on what my project would look like. I also brushed up on some Pytorch.

I was away at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign for a registration day.

I finished all of my trainings and worked on running a few simple models that found online that would help me have a better understanding of what I would be dealing with.
These models identified what images were so if I gave it a picture of a dog, it would return that it was a dog.

I worked on running a simple pretrained Unet model on cloud cover estimation. It was a bit confusing and I had lots of trouble trying to 
use the pretrained model Seongha gave to me. I worked on that for the entire day with still no good result.

I finished using the Unet model Seongha gave to me on cloud cover estimation. I was able to use it on a couple of my images and I believe it gave back accurate results. Next,
I am going to work on doing the same thing but with resnet models. I will start with resnet50.

I didn't complete much today as towards the end I realized that I could not find a dataset that had cloud cover images and their corresponding estimation values. I spent most of
the day updating my code so that it could train a model with a dataset that would be downloaded to my computer.
